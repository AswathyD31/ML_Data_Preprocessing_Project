# Overview:
____
The goal of this project is to design and implement a robust data preprocessing system that addresses challenges such as:

* Missing values
* Outliers
* Inconsistent formatting
* Categorical variable encoding
* By performing effective preprocessing, we aim to enhance the data quality for further machine learning analysis.
